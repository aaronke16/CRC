        Hi my name is Aaron Essien <br>
        I am a senior at the University at Buffalo majoring in computer science <br>
        Here are some of my accomplishments in the past couple semesters <br>
        I really want to try my best to understand the technologies that I will be using instead of consulting AI for an often quick and wrong solution <br>
        Let's see how I can get this HTML/CSS to scale! <br>
